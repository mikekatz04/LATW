    "The python debugger ([pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)) is an unbelievably helpful tool. For me, it is up there with `Numpy` and `Matplotlib` in terms of how useful it has been for me. It has shaved so much time from the development process, it is honestly incalculable. `pdb` allows you to use most one-line `ipython` commands stopped anywhere in your code. In other words, you can stop your Python code and run functions, print any stored variables, store new variables, plot things, etc.\n",

This is a little tedious to get used to and does not work sometimes (only sometimes), but I highly recommend trying it. It is a very efficient way to develop code in my opinion.  \n",

In other words, you can open a python code that is in your `$PATH` and place a breakpoint inside of it. You can then run your code that calls this package. It will stop at your breakpoint. You can step through and print anything you need. This has really helped me in the past to learn better coding techniques and to understanding complex codes others have designed. \n",
