The default `GaussianMove` that we used in tutorial 5 requires an inversion of the covariance matrix. If we sample in the parameters we used above ($A$, $f_0$, $\\dot{f}$, etc.), the scale differences between parameters will cause numerical issues with matrix inversion and multiplication. \n", "\n", "There is a small variety of ways to deal with this. Here are two possibilities:\n", "\n", "1) You can log scale and reduce each parmeter so they are all of order 1. This would involve changing the priors and making sure you include this conversion in your Likelihood function. You can use `eryn.utils.TransformContainer` to do this conversion if you would like.\n", "2) You can create your own proposal where you assume a diagonal covariance and generate the information yourself.
